## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Positioning




### What I learned

I was able to fully understand how to use flexbox to center element and was alson able to understand how to position the svg eye icon and create the hover effent on the NFT preview card component.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


### Continued development

I would love to learn more about positioning and CSS grid system also to take more of front end challenges to get better at my front end skills.
